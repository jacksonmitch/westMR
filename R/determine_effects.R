# determine_effects.R

#' Stepwise Determination of Effect Types
#'
#' Runs the WEST stepwise procedure to decide, for each included predictor,
#' whether its effect is heterogeneous (component-specific) or homogeneous
#' (shared across mixture components). At each step, remaining predictors
#' are tested against a shared baseline fit via \code{test_predictors()}.
#'
#' @param model A \code{WMRModel} object.
#' @param direction A character string, either \code{"forward"} or
#'   \code{"backward"}, specifying the stepwise search direction.
#' @param predictors A character vector of predictor names to test for
#'   heterogeneity. Defaults to all predictors in \code{model}.
#'
#' @return A list of class \code{determine_effects} with elements:
#'   \code{direction}, \code{alpha}, \code{heterogeneous} and
#'   \code{homogeneous} predictor names, \code{steps} (the step-by-step
#'   search log), \code{final_fits} (fits across \code{model$G_values} for
#'   the final model), and \code{final_formula}.
