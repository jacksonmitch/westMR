# select_variables.R

#' Stepwise Selection of Predictors
#'
#' Runs the WEST stepwise procedure to decide which predictors should be
#' included in the model. At each step, remaining candidates are tested
#' against a shared baseline fit via \code{test_predictors()}, and the most
#' eligible candidate (if any) is added (forward) or removed (backward).
#'
#' @param model A \code{WMRModel} object.
#' @param direction A character string, either \code{"forward"} or
#'   \code{"backward"}, specifying the stepwise search direction.
#' @param predictors A character vector of candidate predictor names to
#'   consider for selection. Defaults to all predictors in \code{model}.
#'
#' @return A list of class \code{select_variables} with elements:
#'   \code{direction}, \code{alpha}, \code{predictors} (all candidate
#'   predictor names considered), \code{selected} (the chosen predictor
#'   names), \code{steps} (the step-by-step search log), \code{final_fits}
#'   (fits across \code{model$G_values} for the final selected model), and
#'   \code{final_formula}.
