# test_predictors.R

#' Shared Stepwise Search Driver
#'
#' Drives the greedy forward/backward stepwise search shared by
#' \code{select_variables()} and \code{determine_effects()}. At each step,
#' it fits a baseline ("shared") model plus one candidate model per
#' remaining predictor, compares each candidate to the shared fit via
#' \code{west_procedure()}, and either adopts the most eligible candidate or
#' stops.
#'
#' @param model A \code{WMRModel} object.
#' @param predictors A character vector of all candidate predictor names
#'   under consideration.
#' @param included A character vector of predictor names currently included
#'   in the model.
#' @param heterogeneous A character vector of predictor names currently
#'   treated as heterogeneous (component-specific).
#' @param update_included A function of \code{(set, predictor)} used to
#'   update the included-predictor set when a candidate is chosen (e.g.
#'   \code{union}/\code{setdiff} for variable selection, or a no-op for
#'   effect-type determination, where the included set never changes).
#' @param direction A character string, either \code{"forward"} or
#'   \code{"backward"}, specifying the stepwise search direction.
#'
#' @return A list with elements: \code{included} (final included predictor
#'   names), \code{heterogeneous} (final heterogeneous predictor names),
#'   \code{common} (\code{included} minus \code{heterogeneous}),
#'   \code{steps} (the step-by-step search log), and \code{final_fits}
#'   (fits across \code{G_values} for the final model).
